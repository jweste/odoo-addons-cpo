    'version': '9.1.1',
    'category': 'Purchase',
    'description': """
Allow user to define the package of products the supplier sells
===============================================================

Functionnality:
---------------
In product_supplierinfo, add a "Qty per Package" field to register how many
purchase UoM of the product there are in the package the supplier uses.
All purchase lines for this product+supplier must have a quantity that is a
multiple of that package_quantity.

For example:
I purchase beer bootles.
The supplier sells them with a price per unit, thus the purchase UoM is PCE.
But the supplier put them in 6pcs boxes, and I have to buy a multiple of 6.

Technical:
----------
An init function will initialize this field by copying the values in the
min_qty field as this one might have been used to figure the package qty.
